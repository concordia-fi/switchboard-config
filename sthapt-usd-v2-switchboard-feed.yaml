# Below is the configuration for a switchboard feed that

#
# It converts the USD price of APT to the USD price of sthAPT
# using the exchange rate between thAPT and sthAPT and pegging
# the price of APT to the USD price of thAPT.
#
# The thAPT/sthAPT exchange rate is the ratio of all staked thAPT over the
# all issued sthAPT.
tasks:
  # Fetch the exchange rate between thAPT and sthAPT
  # from the thala.fi taking contract.
