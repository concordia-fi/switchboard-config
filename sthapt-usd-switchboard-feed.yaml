# Below is the configuration for a switchboard feed that
# calculates the price of sthAPT in USD.
#
# It converts the USD price of thAPT from Pyth to sthAPT using the exchange
# rate between thAPT and sthAPT.
#
# The thAPT/sthAPT exchange rate is the ratio of all staked thAPT over the
# all issued sthAPT.
tasks:
  # Fetch the exchange rate between thAPT and sthAPT
  # from the thala.fi taking contract.
